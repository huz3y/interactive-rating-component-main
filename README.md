## Overview

Eventhough this challenge doesn't ask us to do rotating card effect. I added rotating card effect to make it more complete

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating
